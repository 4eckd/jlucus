## Git History

```
cb28a94 - fix: Disable unused payment/auth features to fix build
9f4a15d - feat: Complete Sprint 1 - Core UX improvements and project inventory
```

---

## Future: Re-enabling Removed Features

If payment/auth features are needed in the future:

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js @stripe/react-stripe-js
npm install next-auth @auth/prisma-adapter
npm install @prisma/client bcryptjs
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Restore Files
```bash
mv _disabled_features/auth/[...nextauth] src/app/api/auth/
mv _disabled_features/payment src/app/api/
mv _disabled_features/checkout src/app/
# Restore deleted files from git history or _disabled_features/
```

### 3. Update Configuration
- Add environment variables for Stripe/Auth
- Configure Prisma schema
- Update sitemap.ts
- Test thoroughly

---

## Environment Variables (Not Required Currently)

The following were used by removed features:
```bash
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
# STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_...
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET=...
# NEXTAUTH_URL=https://jlucus.dev
# DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
```

These are **not needed** for current deployment ✅
