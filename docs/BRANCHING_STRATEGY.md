# Branching Strategy - Portfolio Modernization

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-25 **Strategy Type**: Feature-Based Parallel Development

---

## 🎯 Strategy Overview

**Goal**: Enable parallel development of features for fastest possible rollout while maintaining
code quality and stability.

**Approach**: **Feature-based branching** (NOT phase-based)

- ✅ Multiple features can be developed simultaneously
- ✅ Features can be merged independently when ready
- ✅ Easy to test features in isolation
- ✅ Flexible - can prioritize any feature
- ❌ NOT phase-based (phases are too broad for parallel work)

## 📋 Branch Types & Naming

### 1. **Main Branch** (`main`)

- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Protection**: Protected, requires PR approval
- **Deploy**: Auto-deploys to production (jlucus.dev)

### 2. **Integration Branch** (`claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM`)

- **Purpose**: Central development branch, integration point
- **Lifespan**: Entire modernization project
- **Merges**: Feature branches merge here first
- **Deploy**: Can deploy to preview URL for testing

### 3. **Feature Branches** (`feature/*`)

- **Purpose**: Individual feature development
- **Naming**: `feature/<feature-name>`
- **Created From**: Integration branch
- **Merges Into**: Integration branch (via PR)
- **Lifespan**: Until feature is complete and merged
- **Delete**: After successful merge

### 4. **Hotfix Branches** (`hotfix/*`) - If Needed

- **Purpose**: Emergency production fixes
- **Created From**: `main`
- **Merges Into**: Both `main` AND integration branch
- **Naming**: `hotfix/<issue-description>`

## 🔄 Workflow

### **Creating a Feature Branch**

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on the integration branch
git checkout claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM

# 3. Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/navigation

# 4. Work on feature, commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat(navigation): add sticky header component"

# 5. Push to remote
git push -u origin feature/navigation
```

### **Merging a Feature Branch**

```bash
# 1. Ensure feature is complete and tested
pnpm build  # Verify build works
pnpm test   # Run tests (once setup)

# 2. Update from integration branch (in case of conflicts)
git checkout claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM
git pull
git checkout feature/navigation
git merge claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM

# 3. Resolve conflicts if any

## 🔒 Branch Protection Rules

### **Main Branch** (`main`)

- ✅ Require pull request reviews (1 approver minimum)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Do not allow force push
- ✅ Do not allow deletion

### **Integration Branch** (`claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM`)

- ✅ Require pull request for feature merges (recommended)
- ⚠️ Allow force push (for rebasing if needed)
- ✅ Require CI checks to pass (once CI is setup)

### **Feature Branches**

- ✅ No restrictions (fast iteration)
- ✅ Can force push (for cleaning up commits)
- ✅ Delete after merge

---

## 📝 Commit Message Convention

Use **Conventional Commits** format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types**:

- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, no logic change)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Build process, dependencies, tooling

**Examples**:

```bash
feat(navigation): add mobile hamburger menu
fix(contact-form): resolve email validation issue
docs(readme): update setup instructions
style(button): apply consistent spacing
refactor(hero): extract animation logic to custom hook
test(portfolio): add unit tests for filtering
chore(deps): update Next.js to 16.0.1
```

---

## 🎯 Merge Strategy

### **Feature → Integration**

- **Method**: Squash and merge (keeps integration branch clean)
- **PR Required**: Yes (for review and CI checks)
- **Delete Branch**: Yes (after merge)

### **Integration → Main**

- **Method**: Merge commit (preserves history)
- **PR Required**: Yes (requires thorough review)
- **Tag Release**: Yes (semantic versioning)

---

## 🚨 Handling Conflicts

### **Conflict Resolution Workflow**:

1. **Update from integration branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM
   git pull
   git checkout feature/your-feature
   git merge claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM
   ```

2. **Resolve conflicts**:
   - Open conflicting files
   - Choose correct changes
   - Test thoroughly

3. **Commit resolution**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "chore: resolve merge conflicts with integration branch"
   git push
   ```

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### **Use GitHub Projects** (Optional):

- Create project board: "Portfolio Modernization"
- Columns: Backlog, In Progress, Review, Done
- Link feature branches to issues/cards
- Track progress visually

### **Use Todo Lists in PRs**:

```markdown
## Checklist

- [x] Component implemented
- [x] Styles applied
- [x] Responsive design tested
- [x] Accessibility verified
- [x] Tests added
- [ ] Documentation updated
```

---

## 🎉 Benefits of This Strategy

✅ **Parallel Development** - Work on 3-5 features simultaneously ✅ **Independent Merges** - Don't
wait for all features to complete ✅ **Easy Rollback** - Can revert individual features if needed ✅
**Clear Organization** - Know exactly what each branch contains ✅ **Flexible Prioritization** - Can
change priorities on the fly ✅ **Isolated Testing** - Test features independently before
integration

---

## 🔄 Migration Plan

### **From Current State to Strategy**:

1. **Current**: Single branch (`claude/portfolio-ui-update-011CUTvByNJX3R35kfc4gRZM`)
2. **Next**: Create feature branches from current branch
3. **Future**: Merge features back as they complete

**No disruption** - we continue working on current branch until ready to branch out.

| Week 1 | UI Components   | 4-6 feature branches | All sections migrated        |
| Week 2 | CMS + Advanced  | 3-4 feature branches | CMS integrated, chat working |
| Week 3 | Polish + Deploy | 1-2 feature branches | Production ready             |

**Total**: ~3 weeks to full launch (vs 10-12 weeks sequential)

---

## 🎯 Next Actions

1. ✅ Document strategy (this file)
2. ⏳ Create PR template
3. ⏳ Create initial feature branches
4. ⏳ Create production PR for foundation work
5. ⏳ Begin parallel feature development

---

**Questions?** Ask before branching! **Ready to branch?** Create feature branches in batch when
foundation is merged.
